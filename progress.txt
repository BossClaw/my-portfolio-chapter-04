Performance Optimization

[ ] Optimize Images: Compress your images to reduce file size and improve page load times. You can use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim to compress images.
    - Action: Check if your portfolio images are large and compress them.
[ ] Minify CSS and JavaScript: Minify your CSS and JavaScript files to remove unnecessary characters, making them smaller and faster to load.
    - Action: Use tools like cssnano for CSS and UglifyJS for JavaScript.
[X] Lazy Load Images: Implement lazy loading for images, which delays the loading of images until they are needed (i.e., when the user scrolls to them).
[ ] Use a CDN (Content Delivery Network): Host your static files (CSS, JS, images) on a CDN to improve the load times by serving files from servers closer to the user’s location.


Updating Content and Projects

[ ] Projects: Add new projects to your portfolio as you complete them. Remove outdated or less impressive projects.
    - Action: Ensure that each project has a clear title, description, and link to the live version (if applicable).

[ ] About Section: Update your bio to reflect your current career goals, experience, or recent accomplishments.
